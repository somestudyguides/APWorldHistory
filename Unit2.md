## 2.1: The Silk Roads

### The Silk Roads

The Silk Road (named after China's famed silk trade) was the main overland connection between the east and west.

The Silk Road was actually a series of roads rather than a single trade route

Silk Road ran from western China, across Central Asia to cities of Persian Empire (Connections to Roman Empire and North Africa)

The Silk Road spanned 4,000 miles, but most merchants never traversed the entire length

(200 BCE) The Han dynasty developed a series of caravan paths across Central Asia to collect tribute from conquered people and improve trade

Chinese hoped to increase trade by controlling these caravan paths (especially trading for horses with nomadic peoples in the Central Asia steppes)

(100 BCE - 100 CE) despite several conflicts the Chinese never gained control of the Silk Road

(c. 100 CE) The Han expanded empire into central Asia (had access to herds of horses and the stirrups invented by nomads)

Both camel and horses were used as pack animals for the caravans

Pastoral nomads of Central Asia provided the animals to transport goods and the food and drink for caravan parties

For periodic payments by the merchants and government officials the nomads protected caravans from bandits

The ease exchanged silk, tea, spices, horses, fruits, rice, ceramics (china), and paper

The west traded grain, nuts, fruits, artwork, luxury goods and gold.

Busy marketplaces in towns along Silk Road saw blending of cultural traditions, ideas, and technologies (cultural diffusion)

New technologies from China like gunpowder, paper, the compass, and an updated astrolabe spread

Buddhism introduced to China from India along the Silk Road
