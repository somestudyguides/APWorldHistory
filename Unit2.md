## 2.1: The Silk Roads

### The Silk Roads

The Silk Road (named after China's famed silk trade) was the main overland connection between the east and west.

The Silk Road was actually a series of roads rather than a single trade route

Silk Road ran from western China, across Central Asia to cities of Persian Empire (Connections to Roman Empire and North Africa)

The Silk Road spanned 4,000 miles, but most merchants never traversed the entire length

(200 BCE) The Han dynasty developed a series of caravan paths across Central Asia to collect tribute from conquered people and improve trade

Chinese hoped to increase trade by controlling these caravan paths (especially trading for horses with nomadic peoples in the Central Asia steppes)

(100 BCE - 100 CE) despite several conflicts the Chinese never gained control of the Silk Road

(c. 100 CE) The Han expanded empire into central Asia (had access to herds of horses and the stirrups invented by nomads)

Both camel and horses were used as pack animals for the caravans

Pastoral nomads of Central Asia provided the animals to transport goods and the food and drink for caravan parties

For periodic payments by the merchants and government officials the nomads protected caravans from bandits

The ease exchanged silk, tea, spices, horses, fruits, rice, ceramics (china), and paper

The west traded grain, nuts, fruits, artwork, luxury goods and gold.

Busy marketplaces in towns along Silk Road saw blending of cultural traditions, ideas, and technologies (cultural diffusion)

New technologies from China like gunpowder, paper, the compass, and an updated astrolabe spread

Buddhism introduced to China from India along the Silk Road

### Causes of the Growth of Exchange Networks

+ 1:
  Interregional trade expanded in 1300s & 1400s as demand for luxury goods increased in Europe and Africa

+ 2:
  The crusades (returning European soldiers brought back goods) led to renewed interest in products from South and East Asia

+ 3:
  Fall of classical civilizations (Roman and Han Empires) lead to decline of Silk Roads but rise of Abbasids and Tang China reinvigorated routes

+ 4:
  The Silk Roads peaked under the Mongol Empire (1200s - 1300s) who made the roads safer by improving roads and punished bandits

+ 5:
  Traveling in caravans (multiple merchants together) increased safety and camel saddles allowed for larger cargoes

+ 6:
  Trade remained most important motivation for travel but diplomacy and missionary activites also encouraged travel

### Effects of the Growth of Exchange Networks

+ 1:
Cities developed along the Silk Roads (sometimes where routes crossed and almost always an oases where water existed)

+ 1A:
Kashgar in western China and Samarkand in Uzbekistan located on rivers and served as vibrant markets and centers of learning

+ 1B:
  Cities with inns called caravanserai generally sprang up every 100 miles (the distance a camel could travel without water)

+ 2:
  Increased trade lead to innovations in financial systems

+ 2A:
  China was a money economy (using money rather than bartering goods) which spread to cities and empires along Silk Roads

+ 2B:
  System of credit developed called flying cash allowing merchants to deposit paper money in one location and withdraw somewhere else

+ 2C:
  Flying cash exchanges took place in banking houses (which became basis of modern banking system)

+ 2D:
  Merchants used bills of exchange to prove they made deposits in other banking houses, allowing them to withdraw money

## 2.2: The Mongol Empire and the Making of the Modern World

The Mongole Empire covered 22% of Earth's Land Surface

### Rise of the Mongols

Mongols were nomadic pastorlists, horsemen and warriors from central grasslands of Asia

Genghis Khan ("World Emperor") united the Mongol clans, created a disciplined army

(early 1200s) under Genghis Khan the Mongols conquered most of Asia

Mongol armies not large but expert horsemen (invented stirrups so archers could stand to fire arrows)

The Mongols expanded west and conquered eastern Europe

(1236) Batu (Genghis' grandson) invaded Russia but allowed Russian leaders to remain in power if they made annual tributes

(late 1300s) tamerlane conquered Persia and Mesopotamia

Mongols destroyed baghdad ending the Abbasid Dynasty (but many Mongols converted to Islam)

(1279) Kublai Khan established a Mongol dynasty in China (Yuan Dynasty)

Under Yuan Dynasty the Mongols conquered all of China, Korea, and Southease Asia

(1271) Kublai Khan launched navl invasion of Japan ((invasion destroyed by typhoon)

Tamerlane conquered India and established the Mughal Dynasty (Islam introduced to India)

### Expansion of the Mongol Empire

1206

### Pax Mongolia

Mongols brutally conquered people and destroyed civilizations but once control was established their rule was tolerant

Mongols tolerant of diverse religions and customs as long as conquered people paid annual tribute

After Genghis Khan died the empire was divided up among his sons into political regions called Khanates

The Khanate of Kipchak had lasting impact on Russia (Russians called the Mongols the "Golden Horde")

Russia did not experience Western progress for centuries because Mongols isolated them from rest of Europe

Mongols ruled China for 150 years establishing a new capital at Khanbaliq (Beijing)

China prospered under Yuan Dynasty (trade and cities flourished)

The Yuan relegated Chinese to lower status than Mongols and elevated status of merchants angering confucian scholars)

The Yuan respected Confucianism but did not use civil service exams for selecting bureaucrats (promoted Mongols to positoins of power)

Political stability (called "Pax Mongolia") in largest empire in history allowed trade between East and West to grow

Mongols only empire to control entire length of Silk Road making trade safer

Mongol women could be soldiers, own property, be seen in public (high status of Mongol women alarmed other peoples)

Mongols embraced military technology of conquered people (siege weapons like towers and catapults)

(1204) Genghis Khan (hoping to unite empire) ordered creation of Uyghur alphabet (used in Mongolia today)

### End of the Mongol Empire

The Mongol Empire was too large and diverse for one power to rule over in perpetuity (khantes had little contact with each other)
Mongols lacked history and experience with government (each Khanate adopted government traditions of conquered people)

Leaders after Genghis and Kublai Khan were less effective

Resentment against Mongols grew in conquered lands

(14002) Russian people united under powerful czar (leader) from the city-state of Moscow to drive out the Mongols

Chinese discontent with Mongol rule led to uprisings and the eventual end of Yuan Dynasty

The secret White Lotus Society in China worked against Yuan Dynasty and in 1368 Zhu Yuanzhang (Buddhist monk) overthrew Mongols

THe Mongol Empire did not decline and was not defeated (it fell apart as Khans assimilated into the cultures of conquered peoples)

### How Mongols made Modern World

The Mongol Empire is largest land-based empire in history (but was built through brutal conquest)

Mongols stimulated ???? trade throughout Afro-Eurasia (build and maintained trade routes)

Cultural exchanges accelerated ( ???? scientific knowledge to China, medical knowledge and Arabic numbers spread to Europe)

Increased connectivity lead to increased transmission of ???? (bubonic plague spread from Central Asia to much of Eurasia)

Mongols fighting techniques and ???? were adopted by other states or forced those states to adapt to these changes

Development of ???? (used by Mongols) contributed to the end of Eurasian cities reliance on walls for protection
