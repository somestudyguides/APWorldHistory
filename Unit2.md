## 2.1: The Silk Roads

### The Silk Roads

The Silk Road (named after China's famed silk trade) was the main overland connection between the east and west.

The Silk Road was actually a series of roads rather than a single trade route

Silk Road ran from western China, across Central Asia to cities of Persian Empire (Connections to Roman Empire and North Africa)

The Silk Road spanned 4,000 miles, but most merchants never traversed the entire length

(200 BCE) The Han dynasty developed a series of caravan paths across Central Asia to collect tribute from conquered people and improve trade

Chinese hoped to increase trade by controlling these caravan paths (especially trading for horses with nomadic peoples in the Central Asia steppes)

(100 BCE - 100 CE) despite several conflicts the Chinese never gained control of the Silk Road

(c. 100 CE) The Han expanded empire into central Asia (had access to herds of horses and the stirrups invented by nomads)

Both camel and horses were used as pack animals for the caravans

Pastoral nomads of Central Asia provided the animals to transport goods and the food and drink for caravan parties

For periodic payments by the merchants and government officials the nomads protected caravans from bandits

The ease exchanged silk, tea, spices, horses, fruits, rice, ceramics (china), and paper

The west traded grain, nuts, fruits, artwork, luxury goods and gold.

Busy marketplaces in towns along Silk Road saw blending of cultural traditions, ideas, and technologies (cultural diffusion)

New technologies from China like gunpowder, paper, the compass, and an updated astrolabe spread

Buddhism introduced to China from India along the Silk Road

### Causes of the Growth of Exchange Networks

+ 1:
  Interregional trade expanded in 1300s & 1400s as demand for luxury goods increased in Europe and Africa

+ 2:
  The crusades (returning European soldiers brought back goods) led to renewed interest in products from South and East Asia

+ 3:
  Fall of classical civilizations (Roman and Han Empires) lead to decline of Silk Roads but rise of Abbasids and Tang China reinvigorated routes

+ 4:
  The Silk Roads peaked under the Mongol Empire (1200s - 1300s) who made the roads safer by improving roads and punished bandits

+ 5:
  Traveling in caravans (multiple merchants together) increased safety and camel saddles allowed for larger cargoes

+ 6:
  Trade remained most important motivation for travel but diplomacy and missionary activites also encouraged travel

### Effects of the Growth of Exchange Networks

+ 1:
Cities developed along the Silk Roads (sometimes where routes crossed and almost always an oases where water existed)

+ 1A:
Kashgar in western China and Samarkand in Uzbekistan located on rivers and served as vibrant markets and centers of learning

+ 1B:
  Cities with inns called caravanserai generally sprang up every 100 miles (the distance a camel could travel without water)

+ 2:
  Increased trade lead to innovations in financial systems

+ 2A:
  China was a money economy (using money rather than bartering goods) which spread to cities and empires along Silk Roads

+ 2B:
  System of credit developed called flying cash allowing merchants to deposit paper money in one location and withdraw somewhere else

+ 2C:
  Flying cash exchanges took place in banking houses (which became basis of modern banking system)

+ 2D:
  Merchants used bills of exchange to prove they made deposits in other banking houses, allowing them to withdraw money
