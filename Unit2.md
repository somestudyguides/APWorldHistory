## 2.1: The Silk Roads

### The Silk Roads

The Silk Road (named after China's famed silk trade) was the main overland connection between the east and west.

The Silk Road was actually a series of roads rather than a single trade route

Silk Road ran from western China, across Central Asia to cities of Persian Empire (Connections to Roman Empire and North Africa)

The Silk Road spanned 4,000 miles, but most merchants never traversed the entire length

(200 BCE) The Han dynasty developed a series of caravan paths across Central Asia to collect tribute from conquered people and improve trade

Chinese hoped to increase trade by controlling these caravan paths (especially trading for horses with nomadic peoples in the Central Asia steppes)

(100 BCE - 100 CE) despite several conflicts the Chinese never gained control of the Silk Road

(c. 100 CE) The Han expanded empire into central Asia (had access to herds of horses and the stirrups invented by nomads)

Both camel and horses were used as pack animals for the caravans

Pastoral nomads of Central Asia provided the animals to transport goods and the food and drink for caravan parties

For periodic payments by the merchants and government officials the nomads protected caravans from bandits

The ease exchanged silk, tea, spices, horses, fruits, rice, ceramics (china), and paper

The west traded grain, nuts, fruits, artwork, luxury goods and gold.

Busy marketplaces in towns along Silk Road saw blending of cultural traditions, ideas, and technologies (cultural diffusion)

New technologies from China like gunpowder, paper, the compass, and an updated astrolabe spread

Buddhism introduced to China from India along the Silk Road

### Causes of the Growth of Exchange Networks

+ 1:
  Interregional trade expanded in 1300s & 1400s as demand for luxury goods increased in Europe and Africa

+ 2:
  The crusades (returning European soldiers brought back goods) led to renewed interest in products from South and East Asia

+ 3:
  Fall of classical civilizations (Roman and Han Empires) lead to decline of Silk Roads but rise of Abbasids and Tang China reinvigorated routes

+ 4:
  The Silk Roads peaked under the Mongol Empire (1200s - 1300s) who made the roads safer by improving roads and punished bandits

+ 5:
  Traveling in caravans (multiple merchants together) increased safety and camel saddles allowed for larger cargoes

+ 6:
  Trade remained most important motivation for travel but diplomacy and missionary activites also encouraged travel

### Effects of the Growth of Exchange Networks

+ 1:
Cities developed along the Silk Roads (sometimes where routes crossed and almost always an oases where water existed)

+ 1A:
Kashgar in western China and Samarkand in Uzbekistan located on rivers and served as vibrant markets and centers of learning

+ 1B:
  Cities with inns called caravanserai generally sprang up every 100 miles (the distance a camel could travel without water)

+ 2:
  Increased trade lead to innovations in financial systems

+ 2A:
  China was a money economy (using money rather than bartering goods) which spread to cities and empires along Silk Roads

+ 2B:
  System of credit developed called flying cash allowing merchants to deposit paper money in one location and withdraw somewhere else

+ 2C:
  Flying cash exchanges took place in banking houses (which became basis of modern banking system)

+ 2D:
  Merchants used bills of exchange to prove they made deposits in other banking houses, allowing them to withdraw money

## 2.2: The Mongol Empire and the Making of the Modern World

The Mongole Empire covered 22% of Earth's Land Surface

### Rise of the Mongols

Mongols were nomadic pastorlists, horsemen and warriors from central grasslands of Asia

Genghis Khan ("World Emperor") united the Mongol clans, created a disciplined army

(early 1200s) under Genghis Khan the Mongols conquered most of Asia

Mongol armies not large but expert horsemen (invented stirrups so archers could stand to fire arrows)

The Mongols expanded west and conquered eastern Europe

(1236) Batu (Genghis' grandson) invaded Russia but allowed Russian leaders to remain in power if they made annual tributes

(late 1300s) tamerlane conquered Persia and Mesopotamia

Mongols destroyed baghdad ending the Abbasid Dynasty (but many Mongols converted to Islam)

(1279) Kublai Khan established a Mongol dynasty in China (Yuan Dynasty)

Under Yuan Dynasty the Mongols conquered all of China, Korea, and Southease Asia

(1271) Kublai Khan launched navl invasion of Japan ((invasion destroyed by typhoon)

Tamerlane conquered India and established the Mughal Dynasty (Islam introduced to India)

### Expansion of the Mongol Empire

1206

### Pax Mongolia

Mongols brutally conquered people and destroyed civilizations but once control was established their rule was tolerant

Mongols tolerant of diverse religions and customs as long as conquered people paid annual tribute

After Genghis Khan died the empire was divided up among his sons into political regions called Khanates

The Khanate of Kipchak had lasting impact on Russia (Russians called the Mongols the "Golden Horde")

Russia did not experience Western progress for centuries because Mongols isolated them from rest of Europe

Mongols ruled China for 150 years establishing a new capital at Khanbaliq (Beijing)

China prospered under Yuan Dynasty (trade and cities flourished)

The Yuan relegated Chinese to lower status than Mongols and elevated status of merchants angering confucian scholars)

The Yuan respected Confucianism but did not use civil service exams for selecting bureaucrats (promoted Mongols to positoins of power)

Political stability (called "Pax Mongolia") in largest empire in history allowed trade between East and West to grow

Mongols only empire to control entire length of Silk Road making trade safer

Mongol women could be soldiers, own property, be seen in public (high status of Mongol women alarmed other peoples)

Mongols embraced military technology of conquered people (siege weapons like towers and catapults)

(1204) Genghis Khan (hoping to unite empire) ordered creation of Uyghur alphabet (used in Mongolia today)

### End of the Mongol Empire

The Mongol Empire was too large and diverse for one power to rule over in perpetuity (khantes had little contact with each other)
Mongols lacked history and experience with government (each Khanate adopted government traditions of conquered people)

Leaders after Genghis and Kublai Khan were less effective

Resentment against Mongols grew in conquered lands

(14002) Russian people united under powerful czar (leader) from the city-state of Moscow to drive out the Mongols

Chinese discontent with Mongol rule led to uprisings and the eventual end of Yuan Dynasty

The secret White Lotus Society in China worked against Yuan Dynasty and in 1368 Zhu Yuanzhang (Buddhist monk) overthrew Mongols

THe Mongol Empire did not decline and was not defeated (it fell apart as Khans assimilated into the cultures of conquered peoples)

### How Mongols made Modern World

The Mongol Empire is largest land-based empire in history (but was built through brutal conquest)

Mongols stimulated ???? trade throughout Afro-Eurasia (build and maintained trade routes)

Cultural exchanges accelerated ( ???? scientific knowledge to China, medical knowledge and Arabic numbers spread to Europe)

Increased connectivity lead to increased transmission of ???? (bubonic plague spread from Central Asia to much of Eurasia)

Mongols fighting techniques and ???? were adopted by other states or forced those states to adapt to these changes

Development of ???? (used by Mongols) contributed to the end of Eurasian cities reliance on walls for protection

## 2.3 Indian Ocean Exchange

### Causes of Expanded Exchange in the Indian Ocean

(c. 200 BCE) trade lanes of western Indian Ocean developed at same time as Silk Road

Maritime trade routes less vulnerable to political conflicts than Silk Road, more secure, and boats carried large quantities of goods

Indian Ocean trade routes connected Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, China, East Africa, and India

Trade remained most important motivation for travel but diplomacy and missionary activites also encouraged travel

spread of Islam led to increased trade in Indian Ocean (Muslims living in East Africa and Middle East traded with Muslims on west coase of India)

Indian cities like Calicut and Cambay became vibrant centers of trade in India (largely run by Muslims but ethnically diverse cities)

Indian Ocean trade expanded due to demand for specialized products from various regions

India produced cotton fabrics, steel, leather, stonework, pepper

Maritime Southeast Asia known as the Spice Islands (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom)

cities of Swahili Coast in East Africa (Mombasa, Mogadishu, Sofala) traded slaves, ivory, gold

China exported silks, porcelain ("fine China")

the Middle East traded horses, figs, and dates

trade expanded in Indian Ocean as knowledge of the environment improved

understanding monsoon winds allowed silors to complete a round-trip journey of the Indian Ocean in just a year

monsoon winds blow off east coast of Africa between April and October and then reverse the other half of the year

trade expanded in Indian Ocean as advances were made in maritime technology

shipyards on Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and southern Arabian coastline constructed larger ships as trade grew on Indian Ocean

shipbuilders in Red Sea replaced the square sails with triangular lateen sail (better suited to high winds of the open ocean)

the stern rudder (invented by the Chinese) gave ships more stability and maneuverability

the astrolabe perfected by Muslim merchants allowed sailors to determine their position north or south of equator

Indian Ocean trade benefitted from growth of states located on trade routes

Muslim city-state of ???? (Melaka) used powerful navy to tax ships using the Strait of Malacca (key route between India and China)

### Effects of Expanded Exchange in the Indian Ocean

• One effect of increased Indian Ocean trade was the creation of diasporic communities (settlements of people outside their homeland)

• Diasporic communities established for economic reasons provided cross-cultural insights for cooperating governments

• Muslim communities established in trading cities around rim of Indian ocean Southeast Asia, and China.

• Chinese merchants lived in Southeast Asia throughout Indian Ocean

• Jewish diasporic communities developed in China and India

• Trade led to increased importance and number of cities along land and sea trade routes.

• Hormuz (Middle East), Zanzibar, Mogadishu and Kilwa (East Africa), Calicut and Goa (India), Malacca, (Southeast Asia), were important Indian Ocean seaports

• Seaports like Hangzhou and Guangzhou allowed China to link into Indian Ocean routes

• Bantu-based languages spread to Southern and Eastern Africa, blending with Arabic to create Swahili

• New technologies from China like gunpowder, paper, the compass, and the astrolabe spread

• India spread knowledge of how to grow cotton and sugar and new types of rice merged from southeast Asia

• The huge Indian ocean trade network led to creation of indeterminate Indian Ocean region

### The Voyages of Zheng He

• (1405-1435) Emperor Yongle of Ming Dynasty in China oversaw a series of naval expeditions (seeking luxury goods and expanded trade)

• Unlike Yongle, most Ming emperors emphasized self-reliance and limited chinas contact with outside world.

• Seven expeditions lead by Admiral Zheng. He visited places like Southeast Asia, India, the Red Sea, and East Africa

• Zheng He commanded 317 vessels (Chinese junks were largest ships of era with 28,000 men)

• Zheng He visited rulers of over 30 states (reasserting Chinas power after yuan Dynasty)

• Chinese demanded tribute from people they encountered and brought back exotic animals and plants to the emperor

• The ming created most powerful maritime empire in the world at the time (leading to great prosperity for all involved)

• After Yongle’s death Ming leaders ended the voyages (an ethnocentric skepticism about the value of contact with the outside world).

## 2.4 Trans-Saharan Trade Routes

### The Trans-Saharan Trade Routes

Northern Africa was western end of both the Silk Road and Indian Ocean route and was highly active in interregional trade

Trans-Saharan caravan routes connected people living in West Africa (south of Sahara Desert) to the larger trade network

The Sahara has many salt mines (an essential part of people’s diets)

The Sahara Desert and nearby savanna has many gold mines

The people of the savanna and desert traded their salt to obtain gold from the forested coastal area

(c. 100 CE) the camel (“ship of the desert” originally for western Asia) introduced to the Berbers (nomads who ran trans-Saharan trade)

Invention of camel saddle allowed Berbers to ride camels and increase the load carried

Camel caravans led to increased trade by land in Africa (camels can carry up to 550 
lbs. and go a week without water)

Strong leaders created powerful kingdoms by gaining control of profitable trade routes

Kingdoms of West Africa (Ghana, Mali, Songhay) will rely on slave labor and will trade slaves along with the gold and salt

#### The Kingdom of Ghana

#### The Kingdom of Mali

#### The Kingdom of Songhay

(1000s) the rulers of Songhay converted to Islam (capital city at Gao in West Africa)

(1400s) king Sonni Ali conquered Mali and cities of Jenne and Timbuktu

(1464) Sonhay became largest kingdom in history of Africa (using army to control trade routes like previous West African kingdoms)
(1465) 
Sonni Ali demanded total obedience but kingdom became mixture of Islamic and native, polytheistic cultures

This Muslim kingdom had vibrant trade with Europe and Asia

(1591) civil war and invasions by Muslims from Morocco (using muskets) destroyed empire

## 2.5: Cultural Consequences of Connectivity

> (c. 1200 - C. 1450)

### Relgious, Cultural, and Technological Effects of Interaction

(1200 - 1450) various religoins spread using the expanding trade networks

land and sea merchants spread Islam into South and Southeast Asia from Middle East

Buddhism spread to Southeast Asia, China, and Japan following trade routes (adapted it to their own culture and beliefs)

trade lead to increase importance and number of cities along land and sea trade routes

(1200 - 1450) cities on trade routes saw luxury goods, new technologies, religions and culture spread
